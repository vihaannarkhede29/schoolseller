# schoolseller
Schoolseller is a student-only marketplace where students can buy, sell, or reserve snacks and small items at school. Sellers manage inventory and reservations with a personal dashboard, share items via links, and buyers can reserve easily â€” all cash-based (for now) , simple, and fun.
